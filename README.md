I am Nimisha Peddakam, pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Boston. I hold a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I have worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft for 1.5 years after my undergrad.

This repository is meant for the Web Development (CS 5610) course which I have taken in Summer'17 at Northeastern University. It contains all the assignments and the project implemented as a part of the course curriculum.
